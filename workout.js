let ranges = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], left = 2, right = 5
// Output: true
// Explanation: Every integer between 2 and 5 is covered:
// - 2 is covered by the first range.
// - 3 and 4 are covered by the second range.
// - 5 is covered by the third range.
// Example 2:

// Input: ranges = [[1,10],[10,20]], left = 21, right = 21
// Output: false
// Explanation: 21 is not covered by any range.
