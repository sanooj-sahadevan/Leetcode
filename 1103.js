const candies = 7,
  num_people = 4;
// Output: [1,2,3,1]
// Explanation:
// On the first turn, ans[0] += 1, and the array is [1,0,0,0].
// On the second turn, ans[1] += 2, and the array is [1,2,0,0].
// On the third turn, ans[2] += 3, and the array is [1,2,3,0].
// On the fourth turn, ans[3] += 1 (because there is only one candy left), and the final array is [1,2,3,1].
// Example 2:

// Input: candies = 10, num_people = 3
// Output: [5,2,3]
// Explanation:
// On the first turn, ans[0] += 1, and the array is [1,0,0].
// On the second turn, ans[1] += 2, and the array is [1,2,0].
// On the third turn, ans[2] += 3, and the array is [1,2,3].
// On the fourth turn, ans[0] += 4, and the final array is [5,2,3].
